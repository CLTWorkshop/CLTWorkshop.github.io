<h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>


The CLTW community and workshop – inaugurated at COLING (Dublin) in 2014 – has become a critical focus and forum for researchers working in natural language processing (NLP) and language technologies for Celtic languages. In particular, it has galvanised and catalysed research by facilitating communication and collaboration internationally. Our community is interested in language technology for both contemporary and historical stages of the Celtic languages.<br><br>

In Classical times, Celtic languages were found across a wide swathe of modern Eurasia. Today, they are spoken in regions of the UK and Ireland, as well as in Brittany, France. The modern languages are: Irish, Breton, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Scottish Gaelic. Although their hereditary communities are small compared to those of most other European languages, they continue to have a vibrant presence in their traditional areas as well as in urban centres. While Irish is the only Celtic language that has official EU language status (since 2007), Welsh, Gaelic and Manx have co-official status. Breton and Cornish also have some limited status in their home regions. That said, all Celtic languages face the same issue in lacking NLP resources to ensure continued technology support in the digital era.<br><br>

While the Celtic languages share certain aspects of their sociolinguistic situation with other minority languages, their common linguistic features (e.g. VSO word order, initial mutations and reasonably complex morphology) also present unique challenges for the development of robust NLP tools. By gathering researchers from all of the Celtic languages, CLTW aims to share best practice in overcoming these difficulties.<br><br>
